 by default, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller. This means that when a signal is sent, all connected receivers execute synchronously in the same thread as the code that triggered the signal. 
To prove this, we can use Python’s threading module to check the thread ID of the caller and the signal receiver. If they match, they’re in the same thread.
