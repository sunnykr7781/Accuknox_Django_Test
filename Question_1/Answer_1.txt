Django signals are executed synchronously by default, meaning the sender waits for the receivers to finish before continuing. To prove this, I created a custom signal in my accuknox project and added a receiver with a 2-second delay using time.sleep(2). In a view, I triggered the signal with my_signal.send() and measured the time. When I visited http://127.0.0.1:8000/test/, the terminal showed the total execution time as approximate ~2 seconds (Signal sent, took 2.01 seconds). This delay confirms the sender waited for the receiver, proving synchronous execution. If it were asynchronous, the sender would finish immediately, which didn’t happen here.
